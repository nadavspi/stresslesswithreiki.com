             <p>Classes are taught by Atlanta’s leading Reiki Master, Michal (pronounced Mee-hal’) Spiegelman.  Michal is an expert in balanced living, a Certified Professional Life Coach, popular keynote speaker and the founder of Balanced Moments.</p>
             <p>With 16 years of experience as a Reiki Master, Michal has certified hundreds of Reiki practitioners worldwide and has created a cohesive Reiki community in Atlanta.  Michal has a special talent for helping people realize their full potential and lead fulfilling lives.</p>
             <p>At the end of your Reiki Level 1 training, you will be certified to give Reiki to yourself and others.  You will also be encouraged to practice self-Reiki every day.</p>
             <p>To live a balanced and rewarding life, it’s essential to take good care of yourself before taking care of others.  Many of us give so much to other people that little energy is left for ourselves.  This is the value of Reiki’s potential to heal, relax and center you, day after day.</p>
